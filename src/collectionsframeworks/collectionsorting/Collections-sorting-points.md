#Sorting Done by Under hood 
- Java uses Arrays Sorting
  - `QuickSort` sort primitive type (int , float..) 
  - `MergeSort` sort reference type (Integer, String, Custom Objects....)
  - then have `O(NlogN)` Running time complexity.
  - In worst case `QuickSort` may have `O(N2)` but merge sort guarantee `O(NLogN)` 
#Collections Class
  
- This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections.
- It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a new collection backed by a specified collection, and a few other odds and ends.
- The methods of this class all throw a NullPointerException if the collections or class objects provided to them are null.
- We can map the `Unsynchronised` collection into `Synchronised`
